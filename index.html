            <h1>Josephine Claire Wright</h1>
            <h4>August 22, 1952 &mdash; September 5, 2025</h4>
            <hr/>
            
            <p>Josephine Wright, beloved wife, mother, and friend, passed away peacefully 
                at her home in Lions Bay, BC on September 5, 2025, at the age of 73.</p>
            
            <p>Born on August 22, 1952, in Ipswich, England, to Phillip and Margaret Swayne, 
                Josephine lived a life full of love, curiosity, and quiet strength. She is 
                preceded in death by her first born son, James, and survived by her devoted 
                husband, Robert, and their three children: Christopher, Stephanie, and Jonathan, 
                who were the pride and joy of her life. Her surviving family in England includes 
                brothers Patrick, George and Roger, and sister Alexandra. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Josephine faced her diagnoses of ALS and dementia with incredible grace and 
                resilience. Even in the face of illness, she remained cheerful and optimistic, 
                always choosing joy. When she could, she went for daily walks in the neighbourhood 
                and would stop to talk to the many hikers who were hiking to Tunnel Bluffs — 
                always curious to hear their stories and eager to share one of her own. In her 
                final days, one of her favorite things was dancing — often smiling and swaying — 
                to the music of her favorite band, Creedence Clearwater Revival.
            </p>
            <p>
                A woman of many talents, Josephine was an avid reader and loved to travel, 
                finding joy in new places and cultures. She mused about opening a book store 
                one day just so she could spend all day reading. She enjoyed knitting and often 
                found peace in creating things with her hands. She also took great pride in 
                her career that she built over the years — her out-of-the-box thinking, sharp 
                mind, and strong work ethic earned the respect of many of her work colleagues 
                and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Josephine's warmth, humor, and generosity touched everyone who had the 
                pleasure of knowing her. Her legacy is one of love, creativity, and strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                A celebration of life will be held later in the Spring 2026. If you are interested 
                in attending please email (<a href="mailto:jowrightcelebration@gmail.com">jowrightcelebration@gmail.com</a>) 
                as space may be limited. In lieu of gifts or flowers, the family asks that donations 
                be made in her memory to the ALS Society of BC 
                (<a href="https://www.alsbc.ca/donate/">https://www.alsbc.ca/donate/</a>) 
                who supported the family throughout Jo's illness.
            </p>
            <p>
                She will be deeply missed, forever loved, and always remembered.
            </p>

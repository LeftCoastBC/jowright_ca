        <h1>Josephine Claire Wright</h1>
        <h4>August 22, 1952 &mdash; September 5, 2025</h4>
        <hr/>
        
        <p>Josephine Wright, beloved wife, mother, and friend, passed away peacefully 
            at her home on September 5, 2025, at the age of 73.</p>
        
        <p>Born on August 22, 1952, in Ipswich, England, to Phillip and Margaret Swayne, 
            Josephine lived a life full of love, curiosity, and quiet strength. She is 
            preceded in death by her first born son, James, and survived by her devoted 
            husband, Robert, and their three children: Christopher, Stephanie, and Jonathan, 
            who were the pride and joy of her life. Her surviving family in England includes 
            brothers Patrick, George and Roger, and sister Alexandra. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Josephine faced her diagnoses of ALS and dementia with incredible grace and 
            resilience. Even in the face of illness, she remained cheerful and optimistic, 
            always choosing joy. When she could, she went for daily walks in the neighbourhood 
            and would stop to talk to the many hikers who were hiking to Tunnel Bluffs — 
            always curious to hear their stories and eager to share one of her own. In her 
            final days, one of her favorite things was dancing — often smiling and swaying — 
            to the music of her favorite band, Creedence Clearwater Revival.
        </p>
        <p>
            A woman of many talents, Josephine was an avid reader and loved to travel, 
            finding joy in new places and cultures. She mused about opening a book store 
            one day just so she could spend all day reading. She enjoyed knitting and often 
            found peace in creating things with her hands. She also took great pride in 
            her career that she built over the years — her out-of-the-box thinking, sharp 
            mind, and strong work ethic earned the respect of many of her work colleagues 
            and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Josephine's warmth, humor, and generosity touched everyone who had the 
            pleasure of knowing her. Her legacy is one of love, creativity, and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            A celebration of life will be held later in the Spring 2026. If you are interested 
            in attending please email (<a href="mailto:jowrightcelebration@gmail.com">jowrightcelebration@gmail.com</a>) 
            as space may be limited. In lieu of gifts or flowers, the family asks that donations 
            be made in her memory to the ALS Society of BC (
            <a href="https://www.alsbc.ca/donate/">https://www.alsbc.ca/donate/</a>) who 
            supported the family throughout Jo's illness.
        </p>
        <p>
            She will be deeply missed, forever loved, and always remembered.
